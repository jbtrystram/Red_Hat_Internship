# OMA LWM2M

## Background

 - Need for a lightweight protocol as more & more devices are constrained.
 - No standardized solution.

Open Mobile Alliance Device Management is widely used. \\
LWM2M is a reboot of OMA DM targeting M2M

### OMA DM
 - HTTP/XML binary encoded
 - HMAC MD5 for authentication
 - HTTPS if security is needed

One stack for the device management & Application data : saves memory & CPU \\
Synchronisation ! You can't trigger an update whilee rebooting the device.. \\
Designed to be used on top of COAP or SMS \\
Released in 2003, and supported in OneM2M.

## Built on COAP ?

 - COAP overhead : 8 bytes
 - QOS : two types
  + confirmable message
  + Or not

COAP is RESTful : GET coap://myhouse.iot/bedroom/lamps/7/status \\
HTTP verbs : GET, POST, PUT, DELETE \\
1 more verb : observe (suscribe) \\
But all in a binary format ! 

Easily translatable to HTTP, Web-like caching

## What does LWM2M it do ?

### Device Management

 - Firmware + application upgrade
 - Bootstraping (client or server initiated)
 - Configure the device
 - Monitor connectivity
 - Reboot, reset to factory
 - Rrotate security keys

### Application Data

Let you access the application's data in your device.

## What's in the Client ?

Standard objects defined by OMA. Objects have a num√©rical identifier (16bits integer)
Objects are registered by the OMA Naming authority
Defining a new object is possible via submitting an form to the OMA.

### Objects ?

 - Each object may have multiple instances (ID = 8 bits integer)
 - Objects contains resources 
  * ID = 16 bits integer
  * Atomic piece of information with a data-type (string, integer...)
  * Can be READ, WRITE, EXECUTED, DELETED or OBSERVED

  ![LWM2M Client Architecture](./client overview.png)
  ![LWM2M Object](./object.png)

 An access control object allow you to restrict permitions on resources
 Ex :
 * Location object 
  - Latitude = Read Only
  - Longitude = Read Only
  - Altitude = Read Only
 * Device object
  - Manufacturer = Read Only
  - Timestamp = Read & Write
  - Reboot = Execute

These ressources can be acceced by a tree structure : /objectID/instanceID/ressourceID


### Management objects !

Defined by OMA : 
 - Security (0)
 - Server (1)
 - Access Control (2)
 - Device (3)
 - Firmware (4)
 - Location (5)
 - Connectivity Monitoring (6)
 - Connectivity Statistic (7)
 
 Or 3rd Party :
 - Lock And Wipe
 - Key rotation
 - etc...

### Application objects !

Contain the value you need for your application.
Define your own or use the already evailable ones.

### IPSO Objects
IPSO already defined the basic things you need for common devices : [objects list (OMA)](http://technical.openmobilealliance.org/Technical/technical-information/omna/lightweight-m2m-lwm2m-object-registry)

#### Ex : Luminance sensor : ID 3301
 - Sensor Value
 - Units
 - Min. Measured Value
 - Max. Measured Value
 - Min. Range Value
 - Max. Range Value
 - Reset Min. & Max. Measured Values


## How does the server & the client talk

Regular COAP verbs are used (transparrent mapping): 
 -read = GET
 -write = PUT
 -exec = POST
 -delete = DELETE
 -suscribe = observe & cancel observation

### Registration 

The client send the list of its objects along a registration request :
POST request :
 - /rd?ep=node34141 </1/1>, <2/1> .... (list of objects IDs)

Server answer is 201 created : 
 - location : /rd/5A3F

### Data interaction
 
 ![data Access](./dataAccess.png)

#### Read a data ?
 Server : GET /3/0/0

#### WRITE  a data ?
 Server : POST ...
 #### 

#### OBSERVE a data ?
![LWM2M observe](./observe.png)

 **Note** : Batch data access is possible. Response via JSON or TLV.

### Queue management

LWM2M can handle sleepy devices : a window timer is trigered when the device register. The server stop communicating when the window expires

![LWM2M Queue](./queuemode.png)

## What's on the wire ?

### COAP overhead 

8 bytes !

### LWM2M 

** Demo time!**

*registration message is 63 oct (POST) : endpointname + URI path of the device-info object.
*201 CREATED message is 22 bytes (OK + registration ID)
*GET 3/0/1 is 5 bytes (14 byte message)
*"XPS13" answer is 15 a bytes COAP message.


## Security

Mutual authentication is mandatory
HMAC auth or Digest (for each message) or TLS.
Integrity (optional) : HMAC

Encription (optional) TLS via PSK or Raw Public Key mode or Certificate.
